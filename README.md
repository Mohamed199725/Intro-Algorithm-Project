this readme file contains a whole explantion for the exemple of a python code

Function Definition:

def analyze_sentence(sentence):: This line defines a function named analyze_sentence that takes a sentence as its parameter.
Variable Initialization:

sentence_length = 0: Initializes a counter for the length of the sentence.
word_count = 0: Initializes a counter for the number of words in the sentence.
vowel_count = 0: Initializes a counter for the number of vowels in the sentence.
Define Vowels:

vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU"): Creates a set of vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).
Iterate Through Each Character:

for char in sentence:: This loop iterates through each character in the input sentence.
Counting:

sentence_length += 1: Increments the sentence length counter for each character.
if char == ' ': word_count += 1: Checks if the character is a space, indicating the end of a word. If true, increments the word count.
elif char in vowels: vowel_count += 1: Checks if the character is a vowel. If true, increments the vowel count.
Adjust Word Count:

word_count += 1: The last word doesn't end with a space, so we add 1 to the word count to account for the last word.
Display Results:

print(f"Length of the sentence: {sentence_length} characters"): Displays the total length of the sentence.
print(f"Number of words in the sentence: {word_count}"): Displays the total number of words in the sentence.
print(f"Number of vowels in the sentence: {vowel_count}"): Displays the total number of vowels in the sentence.
Example Usage:

input_sentence = "Hello, how are you doing today?": Defines an example sentence.
analyze_sentence(input_sentence): Calls the analyze_sentence function with the example sentence.

When you run this code, it will analyze the provided sentence and print out the length, number of words, and number of vowels in the sentence. Feel free to modify the input_sentence variable to test it with different sentences.
